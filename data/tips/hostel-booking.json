  "description": "A tourist should consider taking a room at a hostel in the historic center of Kyiv instead of a fashionable hotel for a more authentic and immersive experience. Hostels in the historic center are often located in old buildings with a unique atmosphere and offer opportunities to meet other travelers and locals. Additionally, they tend to be more affordable than hotels, allowing travelers to save money for other activities. The historic center of Kyiv is also where many of the city's main attractions are located, and staying in this area will give tourists easy access to these sights. Finally, hostels offer a communal atmosphere that can be more welcoming and friendly than the more formal atmosphere of a hotel, making it easier to meet new people and form connections with other travelers.",
